This is the data repository of the article "Dataset of Python codes to generate skeletal muscle models on each hierarchical level" by Jens Lamsfuss
and Swantje Bargmann published in Data in Brief.

Python codes for generating computer models of the skeletal muscle on each of its five hierarchical levels are provided. All scripts are parametrized 
which allows to generate a large variation of muscle structures. The python files (.py) in the repository are needed to generate the structures on
each hierarchical level. A set of representative output-files (.jnl) for each level is also included in the repository. These can directly be used in 
Abaqus. 

For more information, the reader is referred to the article "Dataset of Python codes to generate skeletal muscle models on each hierarchical level".
